# custard
An experimental game engine for text-only games.

Custard has the following design goals:
- Use as little resources as possible.
- Run on as many machines as possible.
- Don't use any modern graphics APIs.
- Allow serialising the entire game state at any point.
- Be fully playable over [teletype] (yes, really)
